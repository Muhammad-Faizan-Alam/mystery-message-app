bcryptjs library
    bcryptjs is a JavaScript library used for hashing passwords and securely storing sensitive data in Node.js applications. It provides a way to create cryptographic hash representations of passwords using the bcrypt algorithm, ensuring that plain-text passwords are never stored. Its key functionality includes generating password hashes and verifying them during login by comparing the stored hash with the provided password. This makes it highly effective for enhancing security in applications, protecting against attacks like brute force and database breaches. **bcryptjs** is particularly useful in full-stack projects for implementing secure authentication systems.
